## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.


### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be


```
Give the example
```

to clean the install periodically
And repeat until builds correctly (no errors)

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system

Run the following command to get site up and running
```
./gradlew bootRun
```

To get MongoDB up and running Run command in System Console Run as Admin
```
mongo "mongodb+srv://questiachester-dm5eo.mongodb.net/Questwich" --username mandamai
```

Then in browser, go to
